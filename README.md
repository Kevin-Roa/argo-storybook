## About

### Purpose
The ARGO UX Master Component Library is a collection of React components that are used to build the ARGO UX. The library is a proof of concept built to solve ARGO's issues of scalability, design standardization, and reusability. The goal is to have a centrally managed design system which permits updates to be made across all projects from a single codebase. 

The library is built using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), a tool for developing UI components in isolation. 

The library is deployed using [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/), a visual regression testing and review tool for Storybook.
